### ðŸŽ“ What is a web crawlerï¼Ÿ

**It is a program that can automatically crawl web content.**

**I believe that everyone has encountered the need to crawl web information, perhaps because they want to make a report, or want to do research out of interest, and need relevant reference materials. The simplest method is to copy it one by one, then paste it into excel or a text editor to save it, and then do subsequent analysis.**


**If there are only a few dozen transactions, that's okay, but what if there are hundreds or thousands of transactions?**


**Repeat the action several times, and you can roughly break down each step: first enter a certain page, copy the required field information, paste it into the text editor, and then continue to loop until all pages have been flipped. Thatâ€™s it, youâ€™re done.**
